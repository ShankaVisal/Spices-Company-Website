    "content": "Not all cinnamon is created equal. Ceylon cinnamon, often called 'true cinnamon,' comes from Sri Lanka and has a delicate, sweet flavor. Cassia cinnamon, the more common variety, has a stronger, spicier flavor. Besides taste, the key difference lies in the coumarin content. Cassia has high levels of coumarin, which can be harmful in large doses, while Ceylon cinnamon has only trace amounts. For health-conscious consumers and culinary enthusiasts, Ceylon cinnamon is the superior choice."
